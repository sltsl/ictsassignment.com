<h1>Unit â€“ 5 Research links lists in images</h1>
The word "hypertext" means you can display more than just text on a web page. HTML offers the ability to
create links to other resources and add images to a page.
Hyperlinks
Hyperlinks (or just links) allow a user to navigate to other things. This could be another page on your website, a
completely separate website, or even an email address. One of the main goals of HTML was to allow these
"pointers" to be added to a page for easy access. This is done through links.
The tag used to create a link is a, which is short for anchor. The content between the open and close a tag
becomes hypertext that enables a user to access the resource.
The resource being referenced is indicated by using an attribute called href (or hypertext reference). Attributes
are added inside the opening tag and are typically a name paired with a value (called key-value pairs) with the
value contained in quotes.
HTML : - <a href="some url">clickable text</a>
Key-value pairs are used in forms. If you fill out a form, you may be asked for your first name and last name
separately. The form will have a label First name and a blank space and another label Last name and a blank
space. The labels are like keys in HTML attributes, and whatever you put in the blank space is the value. In	
<h3>Accessibility and Links</h3>

If you put a link in the HTML page you're creating, you'll notice that the text between (not inside) the opening
and closing tag turns blue. You'll also notice that the address is hidden. Finally, you'll notice that the word is
now selectable. That is, you select the word to be taken to the resource.
The text that is displayed as the link is known as link text. Using good link text is a key to ensuring your page is
accessible to all users. Phrases like "click here" are disruptive to screen readers and other non-browser tools
used to navigate the web. As a best practice, always use link text that briefly describes the resource being
referenced. You can learn more about ensuring accessibility by exploring the Accessibility Learn module.
Images
The img tag is used to display images on a page. Unlike most other elements, img has no closing tag.
The src attribute is used to point to the location of the image to display on the page, and the alt describes the
contents of the image for things like search engines and screen readers.
Important
While the height and width attributes can be used to specify the display height and width of the image, they do
not resize the image file itself. The best practice is to make the image
