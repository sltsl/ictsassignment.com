	<h1>unit4:- creating html page</h1>
In this exercise, you'll begin creating the web page for your resume. You'll start by adding some high-level
information such as your name and section headers. You'll also add a few comments, which we will use as
markers of where to add information in a later exercise.
This exercise uses any kind code editor . These tools help streamline the development process. No local
installation is required to complete the exercises below.
<h1>Reviewing the code</h1>
Every HTML page has html as the root core element, with all content contained inside of it. html normally has
two direct children, head that contains metadata, and body that contains the information to be displayed.
Notice how you only use one h1 element for your name, and h2 elements for headers for each of the sections.
This is to help highlight the most important parts of the page. Your name is the most important piece of
information on the page; thus it gets top billing with h1.
Finally, there are comments for email address, social media, education, and experience. These are being
used as placeholders and will be replaced in a later exercise in this module.
