<h1>Unit – 1 : Introduction</h1>
Websites are used for many types of purposes. You can create storefronts, allowing a company to sell products. You
could provide information about an organization, such as a digital brochure. Or you might develop a fully interactive
application. Because of the flexibility and pervasiveness of websites, you can create all manner of projects. The first
place to start when becoming a web developer is with Hypertext Markup Language or HTML.
